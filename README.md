# mKGR

The official code of paper **Learning to Reason over Multi-Granularity Knowledge Graph for Zero-shot Urban Land-Use Mapping**.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces a multi-granularity knowledge graph reasoning (mKGR) framework. Only with indirect supervision from other tasks, mKGR can automatically integrate multimodal geospatial data as varying granularity entities and rich spatial-semantic interaction relationships. Subsequently, mKGR incorporates a novel fault-tolerant knowledge graph embedding method to establish relationships between geographic units and land-use categories, thereby reasoning land-use mapping outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mKGR not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches but also exceeds those with direct supervision. Furthermore, this paper reveals the superiority of mKGR in large-scale holistic reasoning, an essential aspect of land-use mapping. Benefiting from mKGR's zero-shot classification and large-scale holistic reasoning capabilities, a comprehensive urban land-use map of China is generated with low-cost.

## The reuslt of our mKGR and its application

![result](./images/china_result.jpg)
**a**, The samples are distributed across various regions of China. From i to v are Beijing, Suzhou, Zhengzhou, Chengdu, and Shenzhen respectively. At the same time, it shows the different OA in each province of China. **b**, An application case for inclusive 15-minute walkability assessment. The shortest walking time from each residential parcel to other land-use categories are calculated and the average walkability values are visualized.

We have published the land-use mapping results of China in [ArcGIS Online](https://www.geosceneonline.cn/geoscene/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=ad747de4b4ad4b558141c638e23960ca).
