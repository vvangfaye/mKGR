# mKGR

The official code of paper **Learning to Reason over Multi-Granularity Knowledge Graph for Zero-shot Urban Land-Use Mapping**.

**Abstract:** In mKGR, we introduce the concept of multi-granularity knowledge graph (MGKG) tailored for the ufrban landscape. Leveraging the flexibility of MGKG, mKGR seamlessly integrates multimodal geospatial data, aggregating them into varying granularity entities within the knowledge graph. Subsequently, considering the real world contains certain noise, we develop a fault-tolerance knowledge graph embedding method to complete the graph. The completed knowledge graph finally yields the land-use mapping result.

## Requirement
Ubuntu 20.04 (or other Linux distribution), one GPU (video memory greater than 12GB and support cuda)
* python>=3.11.5
* numpy>=1.26.2
* pytorch>=2.2.1
* pandas>=2.2.2
* geopandas>=0.14.0

## MGKG Construction

Option 1: Directly download the [constructed graph](https://zenodo.org/records/11311869?preview=1).

Option 2ï¼šConstruct the graph in the [KG_construction](./KG_construction/) folder.

## MGKG Reasoning for Land-use Mapping

Train the graph embedding in the [KG_embedding](./KG_embedding/) folder and infer to obtain the land-use mapping result. 

We have published the land-use mapping results of China in [ArcGIS Online](https://arcg.is/1KjXjq0).
